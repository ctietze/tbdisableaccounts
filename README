== Disable account is a thunderbird extension to manually activate and deactivate mail accounts 

== Attention, follow this instruction to avoid loss of data
Thunderbird does not pay attention to accounts which are not listed in the accountmanager propertiy
mail.accountmanager.accounts

So if you remove or add accounts to Thunderbird, be sure to activate all disabled accounts. Otherwise it is most likely that Thunderbird mixes accounts and you will loose your email data!
